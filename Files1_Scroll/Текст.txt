Here, it inspired:

The stars were reflected in her eyes. Earlier, a month ago, they were not visible in the city. The light of the lanterns and the smog drowned out their faint flicker. Everything has changed. And one of the few advantages of the current situation was the twinkle of stars in her eyes, and the air seemed to have become cleaner. We all had jobs and had a home once. Some had children. Lena had a daughter. She worked as a barmaid, and in the evenings she worked part-time at a "dating club". Simply put, she was a prostitute. Now she no longer has to drive around unfamiliar clients, cross herself every time in front of the apartment door, and pray that everything would go right. This is also a plus. But now she doesn't have a daughter. She got lost in the early days, as soon as it all started.
Lena was "on call" when the electricity went out. No one knew it was serious yet. The mobile connection did not work, the city was plunged into darkness outside the windows of a one-room apartment, in which an excited man was cumming into a condom, and Lena was counting the seconds until the next call. She couldn't take a shower as usual, and call a taxi, and after realizing this, she just started getting dressed. Out of habit, the laundry was piled in one pile next to the bed. The man whose name she didn't want to remember said thank you to her and opened the door, grumbling something at the last about "fucking electricians."..
Lena was very pleased to get out into the fresh air, after the room smelled of fumes. She walked through the dark streets of the city, went to the "base" on foot, and this impenetrable darkness around her now was a reflection of her inner state, and therefore she enjoyed this walk. She did not know yet that electricity and water supply would not be restored. She could not have thought that in three hours her five-year-old daughter, scared of the dark and loneliness, would leave the apartment and disappear forever. She did not yet know that her search would be useless and dangerous... She was just walking down the street.

Now we are standing in a ring, deciding what to do. Dmitry Ivanovich is on my left, followed by Sashok, Lena and Dima. Lera and Olya are sitting on a bench nearby. Faces are barely distinguishable in the darkness. For men, they are covered with stubble, for girls they are haggard and tired..
- I heard shots fired at Kirov. It's useless to go there. - Dmitry Ivanovich was clearly scared.
- No one forces you to go there!  Sashok said.
- Yes, but we need to get more food.  I replied.
The streets of the city were empty only in appearance. In fact, the survivors huddled in the black eye sockets of the buildings. Aggressive, embittered, ready for anything. People huddled together on a random basis. So our group was formed by chance. One cannot survive now. But the problem is that we didn't trust others. As well as they are to us. We still had food, enough for a week at most.
- Who was watching this house? - I pointed to building 20, building 1 on Leningradskaya Embankment. It was a five-story building, and it was on fire. It has been burning for a long time. Smoke was constantly pouring out of one entrance. Black, thick. But there were no flashes of flame.
- I was watching, no one came in. Who needs this burning inferno?  Lera spoke from the bench.
- Let's go there. - Sashok didn't ask, he just stated a fact.
No one argued. Everyone is very tired. And the idea to search the burning house seemed right to everyone. We pulled the bolts, checked the grenades, and went.

Dmitry Ivanovich was a teacher at a technical school. That day, he came home, carefully placed all the food in the refrigerator, which he brought in a bag. He spread a tablecloth on the table. He took out a wine glass from the closet. He put a saucer of sliced cheese next to it. A bottle of Merlot wine, strong semi-sweet. Turned off the light. He turned on the TV. I poured a full glass. He prepared to spend another pleasant evening all alone.
A week after the disaster happened, he was already easily cutting people with the knife he used to cut cheese. He was already drinking vodka easily, and had forgotten the name of his favorite TV show. And the Zenit team, which he once supported, became something mythical for him, from another world. And those people to whom he once gave grades in class, he killed without hesitation. And even with some pleasure and with a certain amount of dedication and ingenuity...

And of course the irony. You can't live without her now. There was a stench in the entrance of the five-storey building. We quickly put on gauze bandages. Downhill, a basement turned into a grocery store warehouse. This is our goal. Dima, holding a pistol at the ready, stood on the left side of the door. Sashok is on the right. Well, I had to break down the iron door. Each of us has now become an expert in this. I didn't pick up the key. I emptied the clip of my Makarov around the castle. Dmitry Ivanovich intelligently kicked the door and was the first to burst into the room. While I was reloading the clip, I already heard the shots. We acted quickly and ruthlessly. The girls were standing outside. They were given an old Kalashnikov, just in case.

Lera just wanted to heat up the water to drink hot tea. For the first time, two days after the power went out, she cautiously went outside. Through the window, she saw people lighting a bonfire in the courtyard of the house. It was autumn, the weather was not warm, and there was not much to count on. Her husband was on a business trip to St. Petersburg, and she did not want to do anything without him until he returned. The neighbor, an elderly woman, was the only person she communicated with at that time. She told her that the electricity could not be repaired yet. That, for unknown reasons, even generators in cars do not work. And that it seems to be a problem not only in Monchegorsk, but also in the entire Murmansk region.
On the first day, police patrols walked the streets, loudly saying that everyone would keep calm. That the power will be restored soon and there is no reason to panic. In the morning, another patrol passed, he announced information about several ambulance stations deployed in the city. On the central square, on Klimentyev Street, Leningradskaya Embankment, Moncha, and Bredova Street. You can get food and water there. Some people panicked after all. Especially those who went with young children. They demanded full information from the patrols and behaved very restlessly. As a result, some were arrested and placed under arrest.
Lera went out into the yard with a pot of water. The neighbors immediately pointed to an old swing, under which a fire was burning, and several more pots were hanging. Lera hung up hers.
The faces of the people around the campfire, and there were about 50 of them. They were tense. The eyes of many were agitated. Someone was even joking. The silence and the measured hubbub of voices were sometimes interrupted by loud laughter.
Lera talked a little with the neighbors. No one knew what had happened...

Not bad. They were all asleep. There were no complications. Only one of them tried to defend himself. A boy, about 15 years old, no more... He raised the machine gun to Dima. The machine gun was on the safety, and while the boy was trying to figure out why the trigger wasn't working, Dima blew his brains out on the opposite wall. There were five other people in the basement. Three girls and two men. Everyone was shot without any problems. We called the girls. Lena and Lera began to put the corpses in one room. Olya remained at the entrance, with a kalash at the ready. Everyone else was assessing the food supplies. Preserves. Dry bags of noodles. Boxes of lemonade, mineral water. There was enough food for two months, if you count on six. The only problem was where to hide it all.
- Fuck! - Lera slipped and fell on the corpse of a boy with a bullet in his head.
- There are brains on the floor, have you seen anything? - Lena was laughing...
- Couldn't you tell before? - and Lera laughed too...
- So, friends of the sabbath of fun, fuck, if you have nothing to do, fuck here, I'll load you with boxes now!!! - I wasn't in the mood to joke.
- Well, you bitch Max...
- Fuck him! - Lera supported...
- Don't fuck up! Fuck everyone here!!!!

Lena was sitting at the bus stop in front of my house. She was crying softly, holding her head in her hands. I haven't eaten anything hot for a week. Food supplies have run out, the streets are empty. And only a few passers-by were wandering around the city like zombies, as if they didn't see anything in front of them. They were walking towards the distribution points. Rumor has it that riots have already started there. Some houses were on fire.
I was tired of walking, I was lonely. I sat down next to her.
- How are you?
- I can't find my daughter.  Lena was talking into the void in front of her.
- What's her name? - I tried to fill this void.
- Dasha.
- What are you going to do?
- I want to go after her..  Her words were punctuated by moans and crying.
- Come with me.

We've made a good profit. All the suitable food was taken away with them. Several machine guns and ammunition. Luck. Where did so many weapons come from in the city? Why are we afraid of sunlight now? Cholera mows down people and animals. Corpses of people and children are visible in the streets and courtyards... They are bitten by dogs. They spread an unbearable stench. People die suddenly. From diseases. from a bullet fired in the back. From a knife that once cut cheese, but now cuts human flesh. The Lord has conceived a global purge. This is not armageddon. The survivors and the tired. People who look more like animals. Humanity has ceased to exist in this city. It's impossible to get out of it - those who tried froze on the road. Or were killed. The only way out is to kill, rob, survive. Stay in groups. Trust the people who are around, but only when you realize that they need you. The one who is not needed will be killed. A week ago, our comrade, my childhood friend, Vova... He got sick with cholera. As soon as we realized this, we tied his hands and feet, carried him to the side of the road, and I put a bullet in his forehead.
